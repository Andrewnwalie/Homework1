The elevator has a great interface, but this was the first time I ever saw rear doors on an elevator, I don’t think elevators need rear doors, people can probably just walk around, like they did on the third floor which has no rear door. 
I mostly use elevators to go up and down, with that said the interface does a good job of displaying the numbers in a format that’s easily understandable. Also, the corresponding buttons are attached to the numbers and spaced out properly which makes it very clear. I rarely use the open and close door feature because they normally don’t work in elevators, I did not test if this feature works on this specific elevator, but the feature is available for both front and rear doors.
The most common sequence is walking into an elevator, then turning around to look at the interface, typically a user has in mind which floor they plan to go to ahead of time, and if that floor is exists by looking at the interface, so the numbers should be very clearly stated. Then they press the button next to the number.
The elevator assists the user by having words at the bottom to explain the floors. For instance it has 1R, BR, and 2R and right under, it states the word rear which the user can assume means rear doors and front on the numbers with the F, also on the symbols that aren’t so clear, like open and close door, there are words to say what they do.
The elevator lights up to provide feedback when the user presses a button, I personally believe it’s virtually impossible to make a mistake besides for pressing the rear doors. Because the light stays on until you reach the floor that was pressed, then the light goes out as the door opens. There’s also a number at the top that displays the floor you’re on. The only reason someone might make a mistake is if they can’t read numbers, then they would have trouble in almost every elevator.
